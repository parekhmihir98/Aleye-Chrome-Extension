# Aleye-Chrome-Extension

Provides occasional and non-intrusive notifications reminders to take screen breaks and prevent eye strain.
Staring at a screen for too long is like holding a heavy box - your eye muscles get tired. Resting your eyes regularly can help avoid headaches, irritated eyes and neck pain. 

Health experts recommend the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Aleye is a reminder tool with customizable options and mini-mindfulness exercises to help you get the most out of your workday.

Features: 

- Set the time between reminders - 20/30/40/50/60 minutes
- Set mindfulness and stretching exercises notifications
- Set a count to tell you when the 20 second break is over
- Set an audio ping alongside the notification
